COMPASS Synoptic CB Porewater Sulfate and Chloride Data - Notes 

Analysis from this year was a bit hectic, not all runs meet criteria for QAQC that was established in later years - especially spikes. This was during the development phase and we are still including this data in the larger COMPASS dataset because the standard curves and check concentrations were fine. The duplicates and spikes were off as technicians learned how to use electronic pipettes with small volumes, had nothing to do with sample or instrument quality.
